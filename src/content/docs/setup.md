# Setup for contributing to TorontoJS Blog

## Pre-requisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - The JavaScript runtime that runs the project
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) - To run the commands and install the dependencies
- [`volta`](https://volta.sh/) - (**OPTIONAL**) to manage Node.js versions
- [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) - To generate SSL certificates for local development

## Getting Started

### (**OPTIONAL**) Install `volta`

`volta` is a tool to manage Node.js versions. It's optional, but it's a good tool to have if you work with multiple Node.js projects. You can skip this step if you want to use your system's Node.js version and don't mind about node versions. With `volta`, you don't need to install node.js separately as it will keep track of the versions for you.

To install `volta` on Linux or Mac, run the following command:

```shell
curl https://get.volta.sh | bash
```

On Windows, you can run the following command:

```shell
winget install --id Volta.Volta
```

After installing, you will need to restart your terminal or open a new terminal window to use `volta`.

Now, when you run the project, `volta` will automatically install the correct version of Node.js for the project.

### Install mkcert

You will need to generate a certificate to run the local server. To do so, you can use [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert).

First, install `mkcert` for your operating system, following the instructions on the [mkcert GitHub page](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert?tab=readme-ov-file#installation). On Windows 10+ you can use [`winget`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/) instead with the command below:

```shell
winget install --id FiloSottile.mkcert
```

After installing `mkcert`, you will need to restart your terminal or open a new terminal window to use `mkcert`.

### Install root certificate

Run the following command to install the root certificate:

```shell
mkcert -install
```

This will add a new root certificate to your system's trust store. That will make your system trust any certificate generated by `mkcert` and allow you to run a local server with HTTPS.

### Generate a certificate for localhost

To generate a certificate for `localhost`, inside the root project folder, create the `certs` folder and run the following command:

```shell
mkdir certs
```

Then run the following command to generate the certificate for `localhost`:

```shell
mkcert -key-file certs/server.key -cert-file certs/server.crt localhost
```

This will generate a `server.key` and `server.crt` file in a `certs` directory at the root of the project.

### Start the local server

Once you have the certificate, you can start the local server by running the following command:

```shell
npm start
```

This will start the local server at [`https://localhost:3000/`](https://localhost:3000/). You can then access the site from your browser.
