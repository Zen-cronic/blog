## `npm install`

## `npm run dev`

The command sets the site to be local so it overrides the `siteUrl` in the `astro.config.ts` file for the dev build. That is so you don't have to change configuration between local and production builds.

## `npm start`

Alias for `npm run dev`.

## `npm run build`

Builds your production site and outputs it to `./dist/`. This is the command ran on GitHub actions.

## `npm run preview`

Preview your build locally, it will serve the production build at [`https://localhost:3000/`](https://localhost:3000/).
This is usefull to test things that don't normally run during development, like service workers.

## `npm run astro ...`

Wrapper for the `astro` CLI commands. You can run `astro add`, `astro check`, and other commands using this.

## `npm run lint`

- `npm run lint:js` - Lints the TypeScript code
- `npm run lint:css` - Lints the CSS code
- `npm run lint:md` - Checks markdown files using astro
