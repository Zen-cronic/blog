	<p>
		This site is made for people. As such we try our best to be AA compliant with <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/"
		>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> and by doing that, try to make the web more accessible and inclusive.
	</p>

	<p>That said, we are not perfect and by being a volunteer run community, we are always improving the website.</p>
	<p>We run automated testing for accessibility issues regularly, as well as testing on desktop and mobile browsers with different zoom levels.</p>

	<p>If you have any issues with the site, please contact us at <em><a href="mailto:organizers@torontojs.com">organizers@torontojs.com</a></em>.</p>

	<p>Feel free to submit a proposal at <a href="https://github.com/torontojs/proposals">on GitHub</a>.</p>
